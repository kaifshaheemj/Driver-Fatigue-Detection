# Vigilant Drive 

Vigilant Drive is an innovative project focused on enhancing road safety by detecting drowsy driving behavior in real-time. The project utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest and Logistic Regression, to analyze driver-related parameters and provide timely alerts when signs of drowsiness are detected

## Objective

The primary goal of Vigilant Drive is to mitigate the risks associated with drowsy driving by leveraging machine learning techniques. By monitoring key driver attributes, the project aims to accurately identify signs of fatigue and issue timely alerts to drivers, promoting safer driving practices and preventing potential accidents.
